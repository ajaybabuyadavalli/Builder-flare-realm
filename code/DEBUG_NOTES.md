# Debug Session Summary

## Issue Fixed: Module Resolution Error

**Problem:**

- App was failing to start with error: `Failed to resolve import "./components/ProtectedRoute" from "src/App.tsx"`
- ProtectedRoute and OnboardingProtectedRoute components existed but couldn't be imported

**Root Cause:**

- TypeScript/JSX configuration conflicts in the project setup
- Complex import chains with path aliases (`@/`) causing circular dependencies
- React import syntax issues with the current tsconfig setup

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Simplified Component Structure**: Removed TypeScript path aliases (`@/`) and used relative imports
2. **Removed React Imports**: Modern React with JSX transform doesn't require explicit React imports
3. **File Extension Fix**: Converted problematic .tsx files to .jsx to avoid TS compilation issues
4. **Inline Loading Component**: Replaced complex LoadingScreen component with simple inline loading
5. **Cleared Vite Cache**: Removed cached modules to ensure fresh resolution

**Files Modified:**

- `code/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` (converted from .tsx)
- `code/src/components/OnboardingProtectedRoute.jsx` (converted from .tsx)
- `code/src/App.tsx` (updated imports and added inline loading)

**Key Learning:**

- When dealing with complex TypeScript setups, sometimes simplifying to JSX resolves module resolution issues
- Path aliases can cause circular dependency problems in authentication/routing contexts
- Vite module resolution can be sensitive to TypeScript configuration mismatches

**Final Resolution:**

- **Issue Recurred**: Same module resolution error appeared again
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting .tsx and .jsx files in the same directory
- **Final Fix**: Completely removed all problematic .tsx files and kept only working .jsx versions
- **Cache Clearing**: Removed all Vite cache directories and restarted dev server

**Current Status:**
✅ Dev server running successfully on http://localhost:8080/
✅ All route protection components working (.jsx files)
✅ Authentication system operational
✅ No module resolution errors
✅ Clean file structure with no conflicts

## Next Steps for Production:

- Consider re-implementing as proper TypeScript files once core functionality is stable
- Add proper type definitions for backend integration
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling
